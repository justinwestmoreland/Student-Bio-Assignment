            <p>
                I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii and lived there for only three years. I graduated from High School in
                Pueblo West Colorado and attended college at the University of Colorado - Denver where I majored in
                Biology. I currently work for Amazon as the Regional Operations Manager, meaning my team manages surface
                transportation and yard operations for all Amazon Sort and Fulfillment Centers in Colorado. I've always
                wanted to learn to code, so here I am. In my spare time I like to play video games, snowboard, watch new
                movies, and spend hours on Reddit. I am also really loving learning how to code!
